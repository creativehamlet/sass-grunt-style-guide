# Abrigo Patterns

Abrigo Patterns is a one stop style guide for application content and development standards. Abrigo Patterns is built upon Style Guide Guide boilerplate by Brad Frost.

[See the demo here](https://bradfrost.github.io/style-guide-guide/)

## How it works
Abrigo Patterns is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator which works quite well for managing the content of a style guide.

The tool can consume and display components from anywhere, but the ideal workflow would be importing patterns from [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) into Abrigo Patterns for display. For more info, check out this blog post (coming soon for now).

## Getting Started with GUI Client
1. Download your preferred GUI by visiting [GUI guide](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis

2. Once you've chosen/downloaded/installed your GUI you will import the [repository on Github](https://github.com/creativehamlet/abrigo-patterns

## Getting Started with Command Line
1. Download or clone the files from the [repository on Github](https://github.com/creativehamlet/abrigo-patterns

2. In the command line, navigate to the root of the project and run the `jekyll serve` command. This will build the static site and watch for changes.

3. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser to see the style guide.

From here, obviously the point is to customize the style guide for your needs and populate it with your content and components.

## Importing components and assets from Pattern Lab
